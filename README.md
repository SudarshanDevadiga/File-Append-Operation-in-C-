# File Append Operation in C++

A simple C++ program demonstrating how to append text to a file using ofstream with append mode.

## Description

This program shows how to use the C++ file handling system to append content to an existing text file. It uses the ofstream class with ios::app flag to add new lines to the end of a file without overwriting existing content.

### Key Features
- File handling with ofstream
- Append mode operation
- Error handling
- Proper file closure
- Sequential write operations

## Code Structure

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream my_file("abc.txt", ios::app);
    // File operations
    my_file.close();
    return 0;
}
